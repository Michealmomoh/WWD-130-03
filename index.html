        Michealson university is an accredited institution by the sierra leone tertiary education.
        The university offered courses in degree in 16 areas of study.University websites host a vast quantity of content, aimed at a diverse audience. Higher education (HE) institutions are huge organisations, often operating as isolated departments or faculties. We have seen how this organisational structure can disrupt clear communication between a university and its students online.
        Michealson university has been knows for quality eduction around the world.
      </p>
      <p>Develop the skills necessary to design and launch websites using content management system (CMS) platform. Adhering to the contemporary best practices of web design, and using top software such as WordPress, students will develop an original, responsive, dynamic website. The course will include WordPress installation and configura-tion, creating pages and posts, media management, styling and themes, plug-ins and other features.</p>
      <p>Building effective university digital presences (services) means discovering and understanding the tasks visitors want to perform and designing coherent paths for their completion.</p>
      <p>This survey’s dataset comprised institutions offering 4-year degree programmes as categorised in the NCES/IPEDS database. We used this selection criterion to produce results comparable to CMS surveys for Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We note that several commercial CMS vendors were negatively impacted by our omitting 2-year institutions, where they have material market share.</p>
      <p>The initial data set included about 2,500 institutions with unique IPEDS identification numbers. We cleaned the dataset to eliminate mis-classified institutions, duplicate records, incorrect URLs and institutions that had closed or merged since the data was collected.</p>

      <p>Overall the top ten systems meet the needs of 90% of the institutions surveyed. However, the popularity of individual solutions varies with ‘institutional size’, which we measured by student enrolment as the data is readily available.</p>

      <h3>[university information]</h3>
      <p>Michealson university is the undisputed champion of university in sierra Leone. I recommend “samuel kicks the Earth” and “samuel bats the Sterling Squirrel into orbit”. The best part is the evolution of the channel. It starts out glossy - agency style with stats and rankings - and you can see the exact moment a TikToker picks it up and goes “no, we’re not doing it like that anymore.</p>
      <p>Michaelson university was working on a “digital prospectus”, the university instinctively reached for my red flag - however, the student think they’ve been converted. By dumping its printed prospectus, the University has given students the chance to build their own digital hub. Select your subject area and course of interest; the site returns a customised page, detailing your campus, accommodation and course summaries</p>
      <p>Michaelson university’s “events and opportunities” calendar is a one-stop shop for wellbeing support. Challenge: You’ve got loads of departments with “wellbeing” in their remit - how do you ensure students know where to find the latest events? Solution: Use tech that is widely understood (a shared Google calendar) and embed it on your website. Result: Thousands of monthly page views and a surprisingly high number of event bookings. You are missing a trick by only promoting your events on social. Have a central hub.</p>
      <p>A University Content Management System Built For You Some of the most renowned colleges and universities trust KnowledgeLake to help them transform their mountains of paperwork into a manageable flow of documents within departments and throughout the institution.</p>

      <h3> code and conduct </h3>
      <p>All members of the University Community are responsible for sustaining the high ethical standards of this institution, and of the broader community in which we function. The University values integrity, diversity, respect, freedom of inquiry and expression, trust, honesty and fairness and strives to integrate these values into its education, research, health care and business practices.</p>
      <p>Michaelson recognizes that it must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and its contractual obligations. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety can be damaging to the University. Michaelson must strive at all times to maintain the highest standards of integrity and quality.</p>

      <h3>method for departmental planning</h3>
      <p>Departmental learning goals help faculty plan the curriculum, assess coherence and sequencing, and evaluate the learning of majors. In addition, they signal the department’s disciplinary identity and provide a common language that students, faculty, and staff share. This common language can facilitate communication and build bridges among various departmental services for students, such as advising and instruction.</p>
